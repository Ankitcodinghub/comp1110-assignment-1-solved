## Purpose

In this assignment is introductory, helping you gain familiarity with the basics

of Java, but doing so in the context of slightly larger piece of code. Most

of the assignment is composed of a series of small tasks.

## Assignment Deliverable

The assignment is worth 5% of your total assessment, and it will be marked out

of 5. However, these marks are [redeemable](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp1110/assessments/redeemable/) by the exam, so if your exam mark / 20

is higher than your assignment one mark, you will get the exam mark / 20 rather

than the assignment one mark. **The mark breakdown is described on the

[deliverables](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp1110/assessments/deliverables/#D1A) page.**

The assignment is due at **[10:45am Friday Week 3](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Assignment+1+Due&amp;iso=20190809T0045&amp;p1=%253A), 9 August 2019** ([time remaining](https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?p0=1440&amp;iso=20190809T0045&amp;msg=Assignment%201%20Due)).

You can find [this deadline](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp1110/assessments/deliverables/#D1A)

on the [deliverables page](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp1110/assessments/deliverables/), where all assignment deadlines for this semester are

listed.

Your tutor will mark your assignment by accessing your GitLab repository, so it is essential that you carefully follow

instructions for setting up and maintaining your repository. You will be marked

according to **whatever is committed to your repository at the time of the deadline**.

Since the first assignment is redeemable, **[late extensions

are not offered and will not be given](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp1110/deadlines/)**. As always, throughout the course, if

some significant circumstance arises outside of the course that affects your capacity to complete the course, please carefully follow the ANU’s [special consideration process](http://www.anu.edu.au/students/program-administration/assessments-exams/special-assessment-consideration), and your circumstances will be accounted for in your final assessment.

## Overview

The assignment is based on a simple children’s puzzle called

[DINOSAURS – MYSTIC ISLANDS

](https://www.smartgames.eu/uk/one-player-games/dinosaurs-%E2%80%93-mystic-islands),

made by [SmartGames](http://www.smartgames.eu), a producer of

educational games. The design of the game and all of the imagery in

this assignment comes from their DINOSAURS game.

![Game Overview](assets/dinosaurs-game.png)

The game is played by rotating and placing six 1×2-sized tiles on a

3×4 grid. Each tile includes one to three paths, which connect its

nearby tiles to each other or the borders. Also, there is exactly one

green or red dinosaur on each tile.

## Tiles

The game comprises six 1×2 playing tiles, which we encode using

characters `a` to `f`. Each tile can be rotated at 90 degree

increments, allowing for 4 different orientations (North, East, South

and West). The following illustration shows all 24 possible

combinations of the 6 pieces and 4 orientations.

![All Combinations](assets/all_tiles.png)

## Objective

The objective of the game is to place the tiles in such a way as to

**create a specified shape of islands** (a *topological* constraint),

with the special requirement that **no dinosaurs of different colors

end up on the same island** (an *ecological* constraint). Each

objective defines a particular topological constraint (i.e. a

particular arrangement of land and water), and all objectives have the

same ecological constraint (red and green dinosaurs cannot co-exist on

the same island). The following sample objectives illustrate three

different topological objectives (i.e. three different arrangements of

land and water). In each case, the player has to determine where to

place tiles such that those topological objectives are met, while also

ensuring the ecological objective is met (red and green dinosaurs

are always separated by water).

![Objective 65](src/comp1110/ass1/gui/assets/65.png)

![Objective 68](src/comp1110/ass1/gui/assets/68.png)

![Objective 72](src/comp1110/ass1/gui/assets/72.png)

Some objectives include the placement of some of the six tiles,

which makes the objective easier. A sample objective shape is shown here:

![Objective 1](src/comp1110/ass1/gui/assets/01.png)

This is objective 1 from the original board game, and is easy to

solve. The placement of the three green dinosaur tiles has been

specified, so the challenge for the player is just to work out how to

place the red dinosaur tiles correctly.

The game is successfully completed once *all* six tiles are placed

*and* the objective is met.

The game comes with 80 pre-defined objectives, organized as four

difficulty levels from *starter* to *master*.

Each time the game is played, the objective may be different.

Some objectives are easier to solve than others. The game is designed so

that the player may specify a difficulty level. In the real game there are

four difficulty levels, each with twenty different possible objectives.

In our version, the user may select the level of difficulty on a slider.

The images below show a possible progression of the above sample

objective. Note that the placement of the three green dinosaur tiles

is given in the objective, so the player would normally place those

pieces first, however, the order in which they are placed is

unimportant. The challenge for the player in this particular case is

just how to place the red dinosaurs in such a way as to satisfy the

objective (since the location of the three green dinosaurs was already

given to the player, in the objective).

![P2](assets/p2.png)

![P3](assets/p3.png)

![P4](assets/p4.png)

![P5](assets/p5.png)

![P6](assets/p6.png)

You can find visual representations of all of the objectives in the

`src/comp1110/ass1/gui/assets` [folder](src/comp1110/ass1/gui/assets),

each as a png image, named `&lt;objective number&gt;.png`.

We have provided you with a

[paper version of the game](assets/papergame.pdf), which you can print

out and use to help you visualise the game if you wish.

## Objective Encoding

In our game, the objective of the game is encoded as two strings, one that

represents the direct connections between islands, and another that represents tiles

that are placed at the start of the game (in the example above, the

location of tiles `b`, `d`, and `e` are prescribed by the objective) .

The `Objective` [class](src/comp1110/ass1/Objective.java) has all of

the objectives encoded for you already (they can be seen visually

[here](src/comp1110/ass1/gui/assets)).

### Locations

In our game we encode locations as (x, y) coordinates that refer to

the points on the board where *corners of tiles* may be

located. There are twenty such locations, `(0,0)` through to `(4,3)`,

as shown here:

![Islands](assets/locations.png)

### Island Centers

All game objectives comprise islands that are created by joining

some number of *island centers*, by appropriately placing tiles.

There are exactly ten island centers: seven centered on the board

perimeter, thus visible on the outside of the board, and another three

in the middle of the board (these island centers only become visible

once tiles are placed). The ten island centers are at locations

`(0,0)`, `(2,0)`, `(4,0)`, `(1,1)`, `(3,1)`, `(0,2)`, `(2,2)`, `(4,2)`,

`(1,3)`, and `(3,3)`, as shown in the figure below:

![Islands](assets/islands.png)

### Encoding of Island Connections

The game objectives are designed such that each objective contains

exactly six direct connections between the ten island centers.

If we consider the objective 1 again:

![Objective 1](src/comp1110/ass1/gui/assets/01.png)

the following pairs of island centers are directly connected:

– `(0,0)` and `(1,1)`,

– `(2,0)` and `(1,1)`,

– `(1,1)` and `(0,2)`,

– `(1,1)` and `(2,2)`,

– `(3,1)` and `(4,2)`,

– `(4,2)` and `(3,3)`

An island connection is encoded as a pair of character tuples, each

tuple representing one of the island centers.

For example, in the connection between `(0,0)` and `(1,1)`, `(0,0)` is

encoded as `”00″`, and `(1,1)` is encoded as `”11″`, and the

connection can be encoded as either `”0011″` or `”1100″`.

All direct connections in the sample objective can be encoded as

`”001120111102112231424233″`, which is a concatenation of six direct island

connections.

Notice that *indirect* connections are not encoded.

For example, in the above objective, there is an indirect connection

between `(0,0)` and `(2,0)` through island center `(1,1)`, but this

indirect connection is not encoded since only *direct* connections

are included in the encoding.

### Encoding of Tile Locations

The location of a tile is encoded as a four-character string, as follows:

0. The tile ID: `a` to `f`

1. The x-coordinate of the top-left corner: `0` to `3`

2. The y-coordinate of the top-left corner: `0` to `2`

3. The orientation of the tile: `N`,`E`,`S` or `W`

### Encoding of Starting State

A challenge may start with some pre-placed tiles. For example, in the

above sample objective, the location of the tiles with green dinosaurs

is given to the player as part of the objective.

The starting state is encoded as the concatenation of four-character

tile location strings. Thus the three green dinosaur tiles prescribed

in objective 1, above can be encoded as `”b00We01Sd11N”`,

corresponding to concatenation of three tile placements: `”b00W”`,

`”e01S”`, and `”d11N”`.

### Your task

Unfortunately your version of the assignment has some missing code.

While the graphical user interface is complete, some of the important

logic is missing, so it won’t work as described above. It is your job

to fix the problems, each identified by a `FIXME` comment in the

source code, so that the code works. Do not change the code except by

following each of the assigned tasks. When those tasks are completed,

the game will function correctly. Check your changes by using the

provided unit tests.

## Legal and Ethical Issues

First, as with any work you do, you must abide by the principles of

[honesty and integrity](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp1110/09-integrity/). I

expect you to demonstrate honesty and integrity in everything you do.

In addition to those ground rules, you are to follow the rules one

would normally be subject to in a commercial setting. In particular,

you may make use of the works of others under two fundamental

conditions: a) your use of their work must be clearly acknowledged,

and b) your use of their work must be legal (for example, consistent

with any copyright and licensing that applies to the given material).

**Please understand that violation of these rules is a very serious

offence.** However, as long as you abide by these rules, you are

explicitly invited to conduct research and make use of a variety of

sources. You are also given an explicit means with which to declare

your use of other sources (via originality statements you must

complete). It is important to realize that you will be assessed on the

basis of your original contributions to the project. While you won’t

be penalized for correctly attributed use of others’ ideas, the work

of others will not be considered as part of your

contribution. Therefore, these rules allow you to copy another

student’s work entirely if: a) they gave you permission to do so, and

b) you acknowledged that you had done so. Notice, however, that if you

were to do this you would have no original contribution and so would

receive no marks for the assignment (but you would not have broken any

rules either).

## Evaluation Criteria

**The mark breakdown is described on the

[deliverables](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp1110/assessments/deliverables/#D1A) page.**

&lt;a name=”p”&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

**Pass**

* Tasks #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, and #6

&lt;a name=”cr”&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

**Credit**

* Tasks #7, #8, and #9 *(in addition to all tasks required for Pass)*

&lt;a name=”d”&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

**Distinction**

* Tasks #10 and #11 *(in addition to all tasks required for Credit)*

&lt;a name=”hd”&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

**High Distinction**

* Tasks #12 and #13 *(in addition to all tasks required for Distinction)*

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** *It is very important that you understand that you are* **not**

*required to complete all elements of the

assignment. In fact, you are not encouraged to pursue the Distinction and High

Distinction tasks unless you feel motivated and able to do so. Recall that the

assignment is redeemable against the exam. The last parts of the assignment are

significantly harder than the others, but together worth only one additional mark. I

don’t encourage you to spend too much time on this unless you are enjoying the

challenge of solving these harder problems. Solutions to tasks #12 and #13

involve ideas that I have* **not covered**, *or not covered deeply in class; you may

need to go beyond the course material.*
